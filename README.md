#  What is WebView? #

:wave:

___WebView___ is best described as a boilerplate for Android apps using the Android ___WebView API___. It's also my first android app, with the (currently unsigned) APK hosted online, which can be found ***[here](http://paradyse.us/webnew.apk)***.

___WebView___ could also be described as a novice in android development's first project he intends to extend.
